                LEHMANN + SILVA presents “Shapes of Permanence”, the first solo exhibition by Alice Morey (1986, London, UK) in Portugal.
Alice Morey is a London-born artist based in Berlin. She studied at Camberwell College of Arts and University of Brighton before moving to Berlin in 2009. She has been exhibiting regularly in London, Berlin and Prague in venues such as Top Schillerpalais (Berlin), Kunsthaus LA54, (Berlin), National Gallery Veletrzni Palace (Prague) and Kunsthaus Bethanien (Berlin) among others.
She has built her art practice amongst an experimental art scene in Berlin and has experimented with building environments in site-specific locations that have been become a heavy influence on her painting processes. She is interested in how the work is controlled by its environment.
Her work breaks down boundaries of traditional methods of painting by using chemical experiments and through creating her own rituals in material processes. Her methods often combine categorisations of objects, painting and performance, and her materials range from clay, homemade charcoal, natural pigments, hydrochloric acid and yoghurt.
There is a dialectic of absence and presence in her work, as well as of permanence and change.
Her paintings’ hazy surfaces often veil deeper layers. Not all can be seen and mutation persists as the art bears the indelible marks of changes through the transformative substances that integrate the texture of her works.
Exploring questions around what remains within artworks and what changes and develops beyond the artist’s control, her work evolves out of this dialogue between the expressive narrative of painting and the immersion of the works within the processes of nature.
