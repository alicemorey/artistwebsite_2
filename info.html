                        <p>Alice Morey's artworks explore biological and ecological entanglements. 
                            Her unprimed canvases are typically smeared, splattered, and stained with 
                            pigment mixed with yoghurt, merging probiotics with painting. 
                            Drawings of flora and fauna jostle for attention next to moments of abstractions.
                             They trade on a tension between figuration and something more reticent. 
                             These works zoom in and out – the pictures contain their own logic, 
                             but Morey reminds us that ultimately art – despite its symbols and 
                             codes conceived and decoded by humans over thousands of years – 
                             remains as unknown as the world it inhabits.
